## Cooking Time and Average Rating Analysis
---
## Introduction
In this project, I aim to investigate the relationship between cooking time and the average rating of recipes. The cooking time of a recipe is the duration it takes to prepare and cook the dish, while the average rating represents the overall satisfaction or quality of the recipe as rated by users. By analyzing this relationship, I can gain insights into whether cooking time influences the average rating of recipes.


Analysis Question: What is the relationship between the cooking time and average rating of recipes?

## Cleaning and EDA

Before performing the analysis, I will clean and explore the dataset. This step involves preprocessing the data, handling missing values, and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain a better understanding of the variables involved. I will ensure the data is in a suitable format for further analysis.

## Assessment of Missingness

In this phase, I will assess the missingness in the dataset, specifically focusing on the variables related to cooking time and average rating. I will investigate if there are any patterns or correlations between missing values and other variables. Various techniques such as visualization and statistical tests will be utilized to evaluate the missingness.

## Hypothesis Testing

To address my analysis question, "What is the relationship between the cooking time and average rating of recipes?", I will perform hypothesis testing. I will formulate appropriate null and alternative hypotheses and conduct statistical tests to determine if there is a significant relationship between cooking time and average rating. The results of the hypothesis testing will provide evidence for or against the existence of a relationship between these variables.

## Conclusion 

By conducting the above steps, I aim to gain insights into the relationship between cooking time and the average rating of recipes. The findings from this analysis will help me understand whether cooking time plays a role in determining the quality or satisfaction of recipes.
